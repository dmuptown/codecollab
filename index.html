<div id="intro">
  <p> <em><b>Have you ever wanted to make your own website?</b></em><br>
  
  <p>If you practice the steps we are going to show you in this guide, you will be able to create your own webpage in no time.</p>
  <h2>HTML and CSS</h2>
  <p> There are many programming languages you can use to make a website. The two programming languages you will learn about here are: <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS.</b> There are many books and website where you can read about these languages in more depth. The purpose of this page is to get you coding. The more you <b>practice</b> writing your own code the more it will make sense to you and the better you will be at it.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h2>Let's Get Started</h2>
    <div class= "howTo">
    <p>Create a folder that will contain your website file structure, and name your website folder. Inside of this folder, create another folder titled <b>&#34;css&#x22;</b> where your <b>&#34;stylesheet&#x22;</b> will go. If your webiste has images, you will create another folder titled <b>&#34;images&#x22;.</b></br>
    
    <p><h3><b><u>REMEMBER:</u></b></h3> Check the names of your files and make sure that your folders are organized correctly&#33;</br>

 <div class="htmlbox"
 <p> HTML stands for <b>Hypertext Markup Language, </b> which is a document used to create the webpages you visit every day.</br>
 <p>Begin your HTML document and in your code editor &#40;<b>Brackets&#44; Cloud 9&#44; Atom</b>&#41; and <em>Save As</em> <b>&#34;index.html&#34;</b><br/><br/>
 <p>Repeat the same steps for creating your <b>CSS</b> file. Instead of ending in &#46;<b>html</b> your file will end with &#46;<b>css</b></p>
 
 <p>You must start your document with <b>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;</b><br> which you need for your webpage to display correctly.</p>
<p> You must begin your document with <b>&lt;html&gt;</b> and end with <b>&lt;/html&gt;</b></p>
<p> All of the content you want to appear on your webpage will go between the <b>&lt;body&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;/body&gt;</b> <em>tags.</em></p>

<p><b><u><h3>REMEMBER: &lt;  /&gt;</h3></u></b> If you don't have both <b>opening</b> and <b>closing</b> <em>tags</em> your webpage won't display your content so <b>check your tags. &lt;  &gt;</b></p>
</div>
<div class="cssbox"
<p> <b>CSS</b> stands for <b>Cascading Style Sheets</b> which is used to style your <b>HTML</b> document.</p>
 <p><b>CSS</b> allows you to style your content. You can create a single <b>CSS</b> document to design all of the pages of your website.</p>
<p><h3><b><u>REMEMBER:</h3></u></b>Your <b>CSS</b> page is where all of your styling will go. All of your content will be in your <b>HTML</b> document.</p>
</div>
<div class="mainbox">
<p> This is what your code will look like:</br>
<div class="codebox">
  <img class="exTwoImageA" src="image/basichtmlsetup1.jpg">
    </div>
    <div class="footer">
     <p>Looking further into the document structure, you can see that some elements will be visible through a browser, and some will not. But each element serves a very important purpose. </p>
