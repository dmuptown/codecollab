    <h1>ABOUT CSS
    </h1>
    <div class="aboutSection">
        <p>While there are other methods of stylizing your webpages, <b>CSS</b>  &#40;<b>Cascading Style Sheets</b>&#x29; are the most efficient when you want to apply styling to several pages. This allows your styling to be consistent throughout your pages. Changes are easy to update and implement since there is only one page to which you need to make changes.<br/><br/> <b>CSS</b> utilizes an external sheet that is linked to the <b>HTML</b> content that it seeks to stylize. <br/><br/> 
        
        Each aspect of the element that you wish to change must be specified. This is called a <b>Style Declaration.</b><br/><br>
        Style Declarations follow a specific format. Each declaration must have a <b>property</b> and a <b>value</b>. A property is the element that you want to change, a value is the specific way in which you wish to change it. The Property is joined to the value with a colon &#58; and the declaration is ended with a semi colon &#59;<br/><br/> 
        Example Format: <b>background-color&#58; blue&#59;</b> the background color is the <b>property</b> and blue is the <b>value</b> you want to change it to. You can think of <b>property</b> like your own body and <b>value</b> as the <font color="blue">blue</font> &#44; <font color="green">green</font> &#44; or <font color="red">red</font> shirt you decide to wear.<br/><br/> 
        </p>

    <div class="exampleOne">
        <img class="exImage" src="image/propertyvalue.jpg">
    </div>
    <h4><em>Here's another example of a Style Declaration:</em></h4>
    <div class="exampleTwo">
        <img class="exImage" src="image/propertyvalueexample.jpg" />
        <p><h3><b><u>REMEMBER:</u></b></h3> The <b>&#34;border-style&#x22;</b> is the property that you want to change. <b>&#34;Solid&#x22;</b> is what you want to change it to.<br/><br/></p>
    </div>
    <h3>Let's Learn Some More About How To Style Your Webpages&#33;</h3>
    <div class="howTo">
        <p> You can choose <b>Inline</b> styling by using the &#9001;style&#x232A; attribute in your <b>HTML</b> document or <b>Internal</b> styling by using a &#9001;style&#x232A; element in the &#9001;head&#x232A; section of your <b>HTML</b> document or you can choose the styling option we've been working on which is an <b>External</b> styling sheet, which will be called <b>stylesheet&#46;css</b> and as we have previously learned, your external style sheet file will go in your <b>css</b> folder.</p>
    <p> If you want to link your <b>HTML</b> document and your <b>CSS</b> external style sheet, this is how you do it: </p>
    </div>

    <div class="exampleThree">
    
        <img class= "exTwoImageA" src="image/csslinkanatomy.jpg" />
        <p>The next step is to designate each element with a <b>Class</b> or an <b>ID</b> This will be within the opening and closing &#9001;body&#x232A;tags in your <b>HTML</b> document. A <b>class</b> will apply formatting to multiple elements, and an <b>id</b> will make changes to a single element. Let's look at this example:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="exampleFour">
        <img class="exTwoImageA" src="image/classandidstructure.jpg" />
        <div class=exampleFiveandSix/>
        <p>After you have added <b>classes</b> and <b>IDs</b> to your <b>HTML</b> document, go to your external style sheet <b>CSS</b> page to apply the style formatting for the elements you want to change.<br/><br/> Now we will apply the <b>Style Declarations</b> we have already covered to <b>Classes and IDs.</b> Here is an example&#58;</p>
            
    <p> In your <b>CSS</b> stylesheet if you are using an <b>ID</b> you begin the declaration with a &#34;&#35;&#x22;. If you are using a <b>Class</b> you must begin the declaration with a &#46;<br/>
    Example&#58; <b>Class&#61; &#35;mainBox &#123; background&#45;color&#58;blue&#59; &#125; and this is how you would write for an <b>ID&#58;</b>
        <img class="exImageA" src="image/idcssexample.png"/>
            
    Each style declaration &#40;with <b><u>Property</b></u> and <b><u>Value</b></u>&#41; should go between an opening and closing curly braces &#123;  &#125;
        </p>
        <p><h3><b><u>REMEMBER:</u></b></h3> <u>Classes</u> and <u>IDs</u> allow you to both organize and style your content. An <b>ID</b> targets a single element while <b>Class</b> targets a group of elements. You can add multiple style declarations by adding a semicolon &#59; after each style declaration as pictured above&#58;</p>  
    </div>
